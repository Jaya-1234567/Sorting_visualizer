The purpose of this Sorting Visualizer project is to provide an educational tool that helps users understand and visualize the workings of different sorting algorithms. By interacting with the visualizer, users can:

Enhance Learning:
Grasp the core concepts of sorting algorithms by observing their step-by-step execution.
Understand the differences in algorithm efficiency, behavior, and complexity.
Interactive Exploration:
Experiment with various algorithms and array configurations.
Adjust sorting speed to observe processes at different levels of detail.

Programming Practice:
Serve as a reference or inspiration for developers learning how to implement sorting algorithms.
Showcase the integration of algorithms with visual elements using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Visualization:
Bring abstract concepts to life with an engaging and intuitive interface.

Features
Interactive Controls:
Generate new random arrays with a single click.
Select from four popular sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Adjust the speed of the sorting visualization using a slider.

Real-Time Visual Feedback:
Highlight bars being compared or swapped.
Sorted bars are displayed in green.

Responsive Design:
Works seamlessly across devices.
